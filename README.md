# Google Classroom User Hack

I had been asked to create a script / program that could take a list of
around 3000-5000 names from a directory and hack them into a csv composed
of three columns: (First) (Last) (first.last) 

First name, Last name and user name.
I simply took the first two columns from the file I was given which contained
names like this (FIRST) (LAST) in all upper case.

So I took that and did some bash-fu equipped with basic UNIX/Linux shell
commands and came up with what you see here.

Code Includes:
convertusers

chmod +x convertusers
run with ./convertusers names.txt

make sure to create a final directory called 'final' wherever you place the script.
you will need to make the names.txt
I just highlighted the first two columns of an excel spreadsheet and copied and pasted in a text editor
to create it. Nothing too fancy. All the fancy work is done in the script.

I will be working with the code to make it better looking and more streamline.

If you have any questions shoot me a message through my profile here and I should
get it and be able to get back with you.
